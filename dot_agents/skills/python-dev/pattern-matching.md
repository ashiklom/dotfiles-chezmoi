Additional examples of the python structural pattern matching syntax introduced in Python 3.10.

```python
def http_error(status):
    match status:
        case 400:
            return "Bad request"
        case 404:
            return "Not found"
        case 418:
            return "I'm a teapot"
        # Combine multiple cases with `|`
        case 401 | 403:
            return "Not allowed"
        case _:
            return "Something's wrong with the internet"

# point is an (x, y) tuple
match point:

    case (x, y):

    case _:
        raise ValueError("Not a point")

        case _:
            print("Not a point")

# Complex patterns with wildcards
